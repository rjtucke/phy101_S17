\centerline{EXPERIMENT 12: NUCLEAR RADIATION}
\bigskip
Introduction:  In this lab, you will be investigating
three types of emissions from radioactive nuclei.  Two
types of these emissions consist of charged particles, 
and the third is electromagnetic radiation.  For one of
the charged-particle emissions, you will first examine 
the relationship between the intensity of the emitted 
radiation and distance from the source.  Secondly, for
the electromagnetic radiation, you will place lead 
absorbers between the source of the radiation and your 
detector and measure the intensity of that part of the 
radiation which successfully passes through the lead.  
Finally, you will compare the abilities of all three
type of emissions to pass through various absorbers.

\bigskip
IMPORTANT: Special concerns for nuclear radiation experiment
\item{1.} This lab involves the use of three different
radioactive sources.  All three are extremely weak and are 
quite safe if you use them sensibly; do not put them in your 
mouth or swallow them.  You will be asked to trade your
picture ID (one per lab group) for a set of three sources; 
the sets will be distributed by certified lab personnel.
Use the sources as described below and promptly return them 
to their storage case.  Your ID will be returned when you
return the case containing all three sources.
\bigskip
   The most stable nucleus is $^{^{56}}_{^{26}}$Fe (26 protons
and 30 neutrons).  Isotopes with mass numbers far from the 
naturally occuring average mass number (for example, 
$^{^{14}}_{^{~6}}$C or $^{^{59}}_{^{26}}$Fe) are usually 
unstable, and can spontaneously disintegrate, or decay, 
resulting in the emission of charged particles.  In addition, 
all nuclei with more than 83 protons are unstable to some 
degree.  The more unstable a nucleus, the more likely it is 
to decay within a given amount of time.  If, in the process 
of disintegration, the charges which remain within a nucleus 
are caused to vibrate back and forth in (very high frequency) 
simple harmonic motion, then very high frequency electromagnetic 
radiation can also be emitted.  

    There are two primary modes of nuclear disintegration.
In the first of these two, the nucleus breaks up by emitting
two neutrons combined with two protons; this collection of 
four nucleons is the $^{^{4}}_{^{2}}$He nucleus, and is 
also known as an $\alpha$ particle.  The rare and highly 
unstable element radium ($^{^{226}}_{^{~88}}$Ra), famously 
discovered by Maria Sklodowska-Curie and her husband Pierre 
Curie, $\alpha$ decays to radon ($^{^{222}}_{^{~86}}$Rn);
half of any sample of $^{^{226}}_{^{~88}}$Ra disintegrates 
to $^{^{222}}_{^{~86}}$Rn plus an $\alpha$ particle 
($^{^{4}}_{^{2}}$He) every 1600 years.

    Unraveling the mystery of the second primary mode of 
nuclear disintegration (and of the weak nuclear force which
causes it) occupied the attention of nuclear physicists for 
much of the 20$^{\rm th}$~century.  The neutron, outside of
the nucleus, is not a stable particle.  In a beam of free
neutrons, half of the (remaining) neutrons will disintegrate
every 15 minutes.  When the neutron disintegrates, what
remains is a proton, an electron, and some antimatter (all
with some kinetic energy); this does not mean that the
neutron had been composed of a proton and an electron (and some
antimatter).  Neutrons are composed of three quarks, two
down quarks and an up quark.  The charge of an up quark
is +$2\over 3$e and the charge of a down quark is -$1\over 3$e,
so the total charge of the neutron is zero 
\hbox{(2(-$1\over 3$e)+(+$2\over 3$e)).}  Inside the
disintegrating neutron, a down quark turns into an up quark 
plus a bundle of energy and charge having a charge of~-e
(the bundle of energy and charge is called a $W$ particle); 
charge and energy are conserved during the disintegration.  
The quark count is then two up quarks and one down quark,
which makes up a proton (with charge 
\hbox{2(+$2\over 3$e)+(-$1\over 3$e)).}  The bundle of energy 
and charge, after it escapes the neutron from which it arose, 
turns into an electron and a piece of neutral antimatter 
called an antineutrino.  The mass of the antineutrino is, even
today, poorly determined, but it is known to be on the order of 
a millionth of the mass of an electron; so for our detector, 
the antineutrino can be ignored.  This same type of neutron 
disintegration is possible, though less likely, inside 
an unstable nucleus.  For example, every 5700 years, half of 
any sample of $^{^{14}}_{^{~6}}$C turns into 
$^{^{14}}_{^{~7}}$N, giving off an electron and an 
antineutrino in the process.  Since, in any living thing, the 
percentage of carbon that is $^{^{14}}_{^{~6}}$C is a known 
quantity, this decay is famously used to determine the age of 
ancient artifacts which were made from plants or animals.  This
second type of decay is historically called beta ($\beta$) 
decay, and thus the $\beta$ particle is simply a moving free 
electron.

    The nucleus which remains after an $\alpha$ or $\beta$
decay event is often ``excited", meaning that some of the 
nucleons in that nucleus are not left in their equilibrium 
positions (or more correctly, their equilibrium orbits).  
When these nucleons eventually ``fall" into equilibrium, 
charges within the nucleus undergo very high frequency 
vibrations (more than 10$^{20}$ cycles per second); the 
frequency is so very high because the nuclear forces are so 
very strong.  These vibrations result in the emission of 
electromagnetic waves having the frequency of the vibrating 
charges; these emissions are called $\gamma$ rays, a third 
type of nuclear radiation.  For $\gamma$'s, as well as
$\alpha$'s and $\beta$'s, the words ``rays" and ``radiation" 
refer to trajectories.  All three types of emissions travel 
in straight lines, {\it i.e.} they radiate directly outward 
from the source (for $\alpha$'s and $\beta$'s, this is only 
true in the absence of magnetic fields).

    The surface of the Earth is continually bathed in a
certain level of background radiation, which is largely
due to the effects of very high energy cosmic rays (particles
emitted by our sun, or other stars, which are so energetic
that they get through our protecting magnetic field).  Few
of the cosmic rays actually reach the surface of the Earth;
most collide with an air molecule at high altitude, producing 
a variety of energetic particles (such as muons, with a mass 
200 times larger than the electron mass) which then do reach 
the Earth's surface.
\vfil\eject
\noindent{\bf Procedure}   

     You will measure the intensity of the nuclear
emissions with a Geiger counter, as shown in the photograph
below.  The Geiger tube (sitting atop the box containing the 
counting electronics) is a metal cylinder, or can, filled 
with gas (He, Ne, or Ar); there is a thin metal wire at the 
center of the tube and there is a window at the tube's lower 
end through which radiation can enter (background radiation 
can also enter through the sides).  
\bigskip
\centerline{\psfig
{figure=/home/gbadams/born/class/101/lab/images/geigergs.eps,height=6.7cm}}
\bigskip
\noindent When high-energy radiation 
strikes a gas atom in the tube, the collision can ionize that 
atom, producing a positive ion and a free electron; the resulting
brief current between the thin wire and the outer can is recorded 
as a count by the electronics.  In the rack below the tube are 
six sets of slots which can be used to position the samples at 
various distances from the window at the lower end of the tube.  
The highest slot is used to position a sample 1.0~cm from the 
window, and each lower slot is an additional centimeter farther 
away. 
\bigskip
\centerline{Part A: Variation of $\beta$ Intensity 
with Distance}
\smallskip
\item{1.} Turn on the Geiger counter and set the high voltage 
to 420~V.  This voltage is applied across the gap between the
metal wire at the center of the tube and the outer can; this
is the voltage which creates a current in the tube after a gas 
atom has been struck by the incoming radiation. 

\item{2.} Take a count of background radiation in the
room on this day by running the counter for ten minutes 
(set Count Interval to 10, then hit STOP followed by RESET 
followed by COUNT).  Record the background count in Data 
Table~11.1.  Calculate the\break background counts 
per minute; record that number at the top of all three 
data tables.

\item{3.} Properly certified lab personnel will be present to 
distribute the radioactive sources.  Once your background count 
is finished, trade a picture ID for a set of sources.  Keep the 
storage case, which will always contain two of the three sources,
on your lab table but as far as possible from your Geiger tube.

\item{4.} Place the $^{^{90}}_{^{38}}$Sr $\beta$-ray source, 
label side up, into a plastic sample holder; then position the
holder as close as possible to the window of the Geiger tube 
(use the highest slot in the rack below the tube).  Some 
fraction of the $^{^{90}}_{^{38}}$Sr nuclei at the center of 
this source are continually turning into $^{^{90}}_{^{39}}$Y 
nuclei (in 29 years half of the $^{^{90}}_{^{38}}$Sr nuclei 
will turn into $^{^{90}}_{^{39}}$Y); some fraction of the 
energy released by each of these nuclear transformations 
appears as a fast-moving electron, also known as a $\beta$ 
ray.  Take a one-minute count of the $\beta$ radiation now 
detected by the tube.  Record the raw count and a corrected 
count in Data Table~11.1; the corrected number of counts per 
minute is gotten by subtracting the background counts per 
minute from the raw count.  Repeat for all possible slots in 
the rack below the tube.  Once you have finished, return the 
$\beta$ source to the storage case.  

\item{5.} Make a graph of the corrected counts per minute
versus distance (distance on the horizontal axis); use a full
sheet of graph paper. 
\bigskip
\centerline{Part B: Absorption of $\gamma$ Radiation by Lead}
\smallskip
\item{1.} Place the $^{^{60}}_{^{27}}$Co $\gamma$-ray source 
(label side up) in a plastic sample holder and position the 
holder in the fourth-highest slot (third from the bottom)
in the rack below the tube.  Some fraction of the 
$^{^{60}}_{^{27}}$Co nuclei at the center of this source are 
continually turning into highly-excited $^{^{60}}_{^{28}}$Ni 
nuclei (about half of the $^{^{60}}_{^{27}}$Co nuclei are 
transformed every five years); as the vibrating charges in 
these $^{^{60}}_{^{28}}$Ni nuclei gradually settle into their 
equilibrium positions within the $^{^{60}}_{^{28}}$Ni nucleus, 
they emit electromagnetic $\gamma$-rays of frequencies 
2.8~and~3.2~$\times$~10$^{20}$~Hz.  Take a one-minute count 
of the $\gamma$ radiation now detected by the tube.  Record 
the raw and corrected count rates in Data Table~11.2.


\item{2.} You will be supplied with a box of lead disks
of varying thickness, and one lead slab of greater thickness.  
Select the thinnest disk, place it in appropriate plastic
tray, and position that tray in the sample-holding rack just 
above the $\gamma$-ray source.  Record the thickness of the 
lead disk, in mm, in Data Table~11.2.  Then count for one 
minute and record the raw and corrected count rates in 
Data Table~11.2.  Repeat for all thicknesses of lead 
available in your supply; you will need to support the thick
lead slab on a piece of aluminum (instead of the plastic tray).
Return the $\gamma$ source to its storage case.

\item{3.} Make a graph of the corrected counts per minute
in Data Table~11.2 versus lead absorber thickness (thickness 
on the horizontal axis); use a full sheet of graph paper. 
\bigskip
\centerline{Part C: Compare Penetrating Ability of
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ Radiation}
\smallskip
\item{1.} Position the $\alpha$ particle source (label side 
DOWN) in the second-highest slot under the Geiger tube (again 
using the plastic sample-holding tray).  Some fraction of the 
$^{^{210}}_{^{84}}$Po nuclei at the center of this source are 
continually disintegrating, turning into $^{^{206}}_{^{82}}$Pb
plus an $\alpha$ particle (every 138 days half of the 
$^{^{210}}_{^{84}}$Po nuclei disintegrate).  Measure and
record the counts-per-minute reading due to this source with
no absorber between the source and Geiger tube; correct your
recorded counts-per-minute by subtracting the background 
count rate.  Repeat with a single piece of paper placed
in between the $\alpha$ source and the Geiger tube.  If the
uncorrected count rate does not fall nearly to background 
with a single piece of paper as an absorber, repeat the 
experiment once more with two pieces of paper as absorbers.
Return the $\alpha$ source to its storage case.

\item{2.} Replace the $\alpha$ particle source with the $\beta$
particle source.  Measure and record the counts-per-minute
reading due to this source in each of the following cases:
(a)~no absorber, (b)~one piece of paper as an absorber (also
two pieces if two were required for the $\alpha$ source), 
(c)~one piece of aluminum sheet as an absorber, and (d)~two
pieces of aluminum sheet as absorbers.  In each case, correct
for the background count rate.  Return the $\beta$ source
to its storage case.

\item{3.} Replace the $\beta$ particle source with the 
$\gamma$-ray source.  Measure and record the counts-per-minute 
reading due to this source in each of the following cases: 
(a)~no absorber, (b)~one piece of paper as an absorber (also 
two pieces if two were required for the $\alpha$ source), 
(c)~one piece of aluminum sheet as an absorber, and (d)~two 
pieces of aluminum sheet as absorbers.  In each case, correct 
for the background count rate.  Return the $\gamma$ source to
the storage case and trade the sources for your picture ID.
\bigskip
\noindent{\bf Results}
\item{1.} Looking at your graph for Data Table~11.1, describe 
qualitatively how count rate changes as a function of distance 
from a source of $\beta$ rays.
\vglue0.8in
\item{2.} We would like to find the quantitative relationship 
between count rate and distance from the source.  In the space
at the top of page~8, make a neat table of distance (in m), 
1/(distance squared) (in 1/m$^2$), and corrected count rate.  
Two of the three columns are just copied from Data Table~11.1. 
Use proper labels and table headings.  Show one example of 
your calculation of 1/(distance squared).
