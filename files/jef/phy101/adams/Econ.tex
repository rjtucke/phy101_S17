\centerline{EXPERIMENT 5: CONSERVATION OF ENERGY}
\bigskip
Introduction:
In this lab, you will test conservation of mechanical energy by
analyzing the motion diagram of a swinging pendulum.  
\bigskip
%\noindent\underbar{Theory}
%
%For an isolated object (or collection of objects) with only 
%conservative forces acting, the  total mechanical energy is 
%conserved. In this lab, we look at the motion of a simple 
%pendulum acting  under the influence of gravity.  The pendulum 
%is a rigid extended object, but it behaves like  a single particle 
%with mass concentrated at the center of mass (CM). Then we have, 
%for kinetic energy,
%    $$K = {1\over2}mv^2\eqno(1)$$
%and, for potential energy,
%   $$U = mgh\eqno(2)$$    
%where $v$ is the velocity of the pendulum bob, measured along a 
%circular arc,  and $h$ is height of the bob.  We can write the 
%conservation of mechanical energy as 
%
%    $${1\over2}mv^2 + mgh = E = constant\eqno(3)$$
%\bigskip
IMPORTANT: Special concerns for swinging pendulum and ink-jet timer
\item{1.} The aluminum pendulum rod is easily bent.  If you
must stop the swinging pendulum, gently slow the pendulum by 
light contact with the insulated part at the top, or with the 
bob itself; DO NOT grab the aluminum rod. 
\item{2.} Timer voltage is 30,000 volts - although not lethal, 
a shock from the timer is quite uncomfortable.  Do not touch
any metal parts of the pendulum assembly when the timer is 
active (on).  Turn the timer off between runs.
\bigskip

You will use an ink-jet timer to create a motion diagram (a series
of dots) for a pendulum bob as it swings.  The time between dots 
will be known, so by measuring the distance between dots, it will
be easy to calculate the average speed $v_i$ between two selected
dots.  The kinetic energy at location $i$, approximately midway 
between the two selected dots, can then be gotten by
$$KE_i = {1\over 2}mv_i^2,$$
where $m$ is the mass of the swinging bob.  The kinetic energy will
be in joules when the mass is in kilograms and the speed is in~m/s.
You will also measure the height $h_i$ of location $i$ with respect to 
the lowest possible point in the swing.  The potential energy of the 
bob with respect to zero potential energy at the lowest possible 
point in the swing can then be gotten by
$$PE_i = mgh_i.$$
The potential energy will be in joules when the mass is in kilograms,
the height is in meters, and the gravitational acceleration is 
in~m/s$^2$.  By checking the sum of $KE_i$ plus $PE_i$ at many 
different locations, it will be a simple matter to see if the total 
mechanical energy
$$ME_i = KE_i + PE_i$$
is really constant for this swinging pendulum.

\noindent{\bf Procedure}

A side view of the apparatus is shown below (not to scale).
\smallskip
\centerline{\psfig
{figure=/home/gbadams/born/class/122/pendulum.eps,height=5.33cm}}
\item{1.} The top edge of the metal backing plate will be aligned with 
the horizontal.  Carefully tape your recording paper to the backing plate, 
making sure that the top edge of the paper is aligned with the top edge
of the plate.  Set the ink-jet timer for 60 sparks/sec.

\item{2.} Mark the bottom point of the pendulum swing by making a short 
spark while the pendulum is hanging vertically at rest.  Put a square 
around this dot so that you don't confuse it with the dots in your motion 
diagram.  

\item{3.} Practice a few pendulum swings without operating the timer.  
It is easy to tear the paper, so you must take care to launch the 
pendulum in the plane of the backing plate.  Use the fine nylon 
string pulled over the marked bolt to get good launches.  If your 
recording paper is taped flat against the plate, there should be no 
contact between the ink-jet nozzle and the paper during the swing.  

\item{4.} You will want to make sparks for only one direction of 
swing, not across and back.  You do not have to start the timer 
during the first swing after release; you may start it near the 
beginning of any downswing.  You only need one ink-jet record.  
BE SURE TO NOTE, on your recording paper, in which direction the 
pendulum is swinging during your recorded swing.

\item{5.} Make sure the spark timer is off.  Remove your recording 
paper from the backing plate for analysis.  Pick a dot, not too 
close to the beginning (where the dots might be very close together).  
Circle that dot, and also EVERY OTHER DOT in your motion diagram 
after the first selected dot.  Then go back and label the 
``in-between" dots as dot \#1, \#2, etc.

\item{6.} Measure $d_i$, the distance between each pair of 
successive circled dots.  Record each $d_i$ in Data~Table~5.1.
\vfil\eject
\item{7.} On your recording paper, draw a line which is parallel 
to the top edge of the paper and which passes through the dot with 
the square around it.  Be very careful to insure that this line
is parallel to the top edge of the paper.  Measure $h_i$, the 
altitude of each labeled point with respect to this line, and
record that value in Data~Table~5.1.  
\smallskip
%Analysis:  Let $m$ be the mass of the pendulum bob (the mass of
%the rod is small and can be neglected).  If mechanical energy
%is conserved, then
%$$K + U = {1\over2}mv^2 + mgh\eqno(1)$$
%\noindent will be a constant, where $v$ is the speed of the pendulum 
%bob, measured along the circular arc, and $h$ is height of the bob,
%measured from any selected horizontal line.  The location of your
%horizontal reference line is your option, but be sure that your
%measurements and your calculations are both consistent with your 
%choice.  In your conclusion, give the reasons for your choice and
%discuss how a different choice would have affected energy conservation.

%We will not measure the mass of the bob; instead, we will
%divide equation (1) by $m$; the quantity ${1\over2}v^2 + gh$
%(in J/kg) must also be constant.  
%\bigskip
\noindent{\bf Results}

\item{1.}  Calculate the average speed $v_i$ of the bob in each
interval $i$ for which the labeled dots mark the timewise 
midpoints.  In each case, this is just $d_i$ divided by 1/30$^{th}$ 
of a second (because there is 1/60$^{th}$ of a second between
each two dots and we took every other dot).  Enter these values 
in Data~Table~5.1.  These calculated speeds are only approximately 
the bob speeds at the labeled locations, because the path of the bob 
is not a straight line between two successive circled dots, and 
because the bob is always speeding up or slowing down (except 
exactly at the lowest point in the swing).  However, you should 
find that this approximation is sufficiently accurate for our 
purposes.  Show a sample calculation of one selected $v_i$ in
the space below.
\vglue1.2in 
\item{2.}  Calculate the kinetic energy of the bob (in~mJ) 
at each labeled point.  The mass of the bob is 592~g (0.592~kg).  
Enter these values of $KE_i$ in Data~Table~5.1.  Make a graph of 
these values, placing the energy on the $y$-axis of your graph 
and the point numbers on the $x$-axis.  Show a sample calculation
of one selected $KE_i$ in the space below; get a value in joules
and convert to~mJ.
\vglue1.2in 
\item{3.}  Calculate the potential energy of the bob (in~mJ)
at each labeled point.  Use 9.8~m/s$^2$ for the acceleration due
to gravity.  Enter these values of $PE_i$ in Data~Table~5.1.  
Also enter these values on your graph.  If possible, for values
of $PE_i$, use a different color ink or pencil than you used for
values of $KE_i$.  Show a sample calculation of one selected 
$PE_i$ at the top of the next page; get a value in joules and 
convert to~mJ.
\vfil\eject
\nopagenumbers
\vglue1.2in 
\item{4.} Calculate the total mechanical energy of the bob at
each labeled point.  Enter these values in Data~Table~5.1
and also on your graph.  Is this graph a flat line?  If not,
give a reasonable explanation for the deviation from a flat 
line.
\vglue2.0in 
%\item{3.}  If we \underbar{assume} that the mechanical energy is 
%constant, then we can use our data to determine a measured value
%of $g$.  Plot ${1\over2}v^2$ versus $h$; from the slope of this plot 
%determine $g$ and $\sigma_g$.  Compare your result with the accepted 
%value of $g$.
%\bigskip
\noindent{\bf Going Further}

\item{1.}  Make a force diagram for the bob at some general 
location (not the starting point and not near the lowest point
in the swing).  Identify all forces acting on the swinging bob.
\vglue1.5in
\item{2.}  Conservation of Mechanical Energy for the swinging
bob turns out to be exactly the same as for a falling ball.
Yet your force diagram for the swinging bob should include one 
force besides gravity.  Why does that force not affect the 
mechanical energy?
