\section*{Course Description}

Emphasizes applications of physics to life in the modern world.
Presumes understanding of elementary algebra.

\section*{Grading}

The grading scale is a simple linear scale: $\ge$90\% is an A and
so on. Grading percentages are as follows.


\subsection*{Homework (30\% of grade)}

Most homework is assigned through the online Mastering Physics system.
There will also be some written homework and in-class work over the
semester. The lowest homework set score will be dropped when calculating
the final grade


\subsection*{Labs (20\% of grade)}

A lab manual will be given to you on the first day of class. 20\%
of your course grade will be based on the labs. You will not receive
a separate grade for the laboratory section. Failure to complete 70\%
of the laboratory experiments will result in a withdrawal (W) grade
for the course. Your lowest lab score will be dropped when calculating
the final grade.

\subsection*{Quizzes (10\% of grade)}

Quizzes will be given frequently. Quizzes count for only a
small part of your grade but will help you keep track of your mastery of the
material. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped when calculating the final grade.

\subsection*{Exams (40\% of grade)}

Three in-class exams will be given during the semester. The final exam will be 
held on December 5 and it will be comprehensive.
