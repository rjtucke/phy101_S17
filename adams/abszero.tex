\centerline{EXPERIMENT 6: ABSOLUTE ZERO}
\bigskip
Introduction: In this lab, you will use the relationship
between temperature and volume for a gaseous substance
(we will use air) to determine the temperature at which
all molecular motion would cease; this temperature is
called absolute zero.
\bigskip
IMPORTANT: Special concerns for absolute zero experiment
\item{1.} This lab uses steam; both the steam generator
and the steam itself can be dangerously hot.  Use caution
when near the generator and when near escaping steam.
\item{2.} This lab uses a bead of mercury, which is 
poisonous. If for any reason the mercury gets out of the
tube, inform the TA immediately.
\bigskip
In a container which is free to expand against the pressure
of the air surrounding it, the volume of the gas in the 
container depends on the average speed of the atoms and/or 
molecules which make up that gas.  When the gas is heated, 
the gas molecules move faster on average and, as a result, 
each gas molecule makes more collisions per second with the 
walls of its container; each collision is also, on average,
more energetic.  As a result, any container walls which are 
free to move will move outward, and thus the volume of the 
gas will increase.  As the volume increases, the gas 
molecules have to travel farther and farther between 
repeated collisions with the moveable wall, so the collision 
rate (which had been increased by the rising temperature) is
somewhat reduced by the increasing volume.  Eventually these
two effects equalize, and the contact force on the moveable
wall by the gas is once again equal to the contact force on
the other side of the wall by the outside air; at this point 
the wall stops moving outward.  

In the situation described above, it can be shown that the 
final volume of the gas $V$ is proportional to the average 
kinetic energy of the gas molecules.  But it is also true 
that the absolute temperature $T_K$ of the gas in Kelvin
is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the gas 
molecules; therefore 
$$V\propto T_K$$
{\it i.e.} the volume of the gas is proportional to the 
absolute temperature of the gas.  If the average kinetic 
energy of the gas molecules were to become zero, then the 
volume of the gas would also be zero.  In practice, this 
situation cannot occur, because the gas will always turn 
into a liquid (and then into a solid) before this could 
happen.  But, by measuring the volume at various temperatures, 
we can create a graph of volume versus temperature; we can 
then extend that graph into the region where the volume 
would be zero to see at what temperature that zero volume 
would occur.

   The gas we will use will be air.  The container for our 
gas is a slender glass tube; the moveable wall of that container 
is created by a bead of mercury trapped within the tube.  The 
other end of the tube is sealed with a rubber cap.  The slender
glass tube is located along the centerline of, and thus surrounded
by, a much larger glass tube; we will heat (or cool) the slender 
tube by running hot (or cold) water, or steam, through the larger 
tube.  As the slender tube is heated, the air inside will expand by 
pushing the bead of mercury outward.  When the slender tube is 
cooled, the push on the bead from the outside air becomes slightly 
bigger than the push on the bead by the inside air and the 
bead will move inward until the inside and outside contact forces
again equalize.  Instead of measuring the volume of the 
column of air, we will measure only the length (since the
area of the tube is constant, the volume of the air column
will be proportional to its length).

\noindent{\bf Procedure}

\item{1.} Fill the steam generator about half full of water and 
turn on the hot-pad. Caution: the steam generator will get very 
hot! It takes a while for the water to boil, so to work efficiently 
you will want to carry out the measurements with ice water and 
then hot tap water while the steam generator is heating.

\item{2.} At room temperature, measure the length of the 
column of air trapped between the rubber stopper and the 
mercury bead. Be sure to identify the true end of the air
column as hidden by the rubber cap.  The aluminum square may 
help determine the bead's position along the meter stick. At 
room temperature, the bead should be positioned about 
two-thirds of the way from the rubber cap to the open end of 
the central tube.  Alert your TA if this is not the case.  
Record room temperature, as indicated by the wall 
thermometer, and your measured length for the air column in 
Data Table 6.1.

\item{3.} Arrange the plumbing so that the funnel is 
connected to the entrance tube.  Tilt the tube such that the
exit end is slightly higher than the entrance end.  In this
configuration, when you run water through the tube, air
bubbles will be able to escape.  Fill the funnel with ice
and pour cold water through the ice and into the large 
tube.  Catch draining water in a plastic beaker and recycle 
it; use two beakers so that one is always in the catch 
position.  Continue this procedure until the drain water
is consistently the same temperature as the icewater in the
funnel ($\sim$0$^\circ$ C) and the mercury bead has stopped 
moving.  Note that keeping the thermometer permanently in the 
exit tube will restrict the water flow and lengthen your 
waiting time; insert the thermometer only as long as needed
to get an accurate temperature reading.  Record the final 
temperature and the resulting length of the air column in 
Data Table 6.1.

\psrotatefirst
\item{4.} Repeat step three but using hot tap water instead
of ice water.  Record the final temperature and the resulting
length of the air column in Data Table 6.1.

\item{5.} Tilt the tube so that the entrance end is now
slightly higher than the exit end (see the figure on 
the following page).  Re-arrange the plumbing to attach 
the steam generator to the entrance tube. CAUTION: The 
outer tube and the thermometer will get very hot! The
downward tilt will permit the escape of any water that 
condenses in the tube.  The thermometer may now be left
in the exit tube for most of the time; carefully remove
it occasionaly to allow condensed water to escape.  When
the temperature at the exit is constant and the mercury
bead has stopped moving, again measure the length of the
air column.  Record the final temperature and the length
of the air column in Data Table 6.1.

\noindent{\bf Results}

\item{1.} Extrapolation by hand:~~Make a graph with the
$x$-axis running from -350$^\circ$C to +100$^\circ$C;
the $y$-axis should run from 0.0~cm (which would 
correspond to zero volume and no molecular motion) to
about 100~cm.  Plot your data points and use a ruler to 
make a best-fit straight line in the region of the data 
points.  Use your ruler to extend that line (in the 
region with no data, draw the line as a dotted line, not 
a solid line) until it crosses the $x$-axis.  Where the
dotted line crosses the $x$-axis is your projected, or
extrapolated, Celsius temperature for absolute zero.

\item{2.}  Extrapolation by calculation:~~Make a new
graph with the $x$-axis running from 0$^\circ$C to
100$^\circ$C; the $y$-axis should run from a few cm
below your shortest measured length to a few cm above
your longest measured length.  Plot your data points 
and draw a best-fit line using a ruler.  Determine the 
slope of that best-fit line in units of cm/$^\circ$C.
Show your calculation of slope below.  Determine the
$y$-intercept of this graph in cm (you should 
have a data point with a temperature very close to 
0$^\circ$C).  Since, from high-school algebra, we know 
that $y$~=~$mx$+$b$ is the equation of a straight line,
and since we now have the slope $m$ and the 
$y$-intercept $b$, we can calculate the value of $x$
when $y$ equals zero (i.e. the value of temperature
when the length equals zero) from the equation
$$x = -b/m ~~~~~~~~~~~
({\rm the~value~of}~x~{\rm when}~y~{\rm equals~zero}).$$
Use this equation to calculate the extrapolated Celsius
temperature at which the length will equal zero, and
show your calculation below, taking care of your units.
