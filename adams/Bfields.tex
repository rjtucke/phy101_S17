\centerline{EXPERIMENT 10: MAGNETIC FIELDS}
\bigskip
Introduction:  In this lab, you will use compasses to
investigate the magnetic field of a bar magnet
and the magnetic field of a long straight current.

  The magnetic field is our way of describing the condition
of space around a bar magnet or around any moving charge,
such as the moving charges in a current.  If a magnetic field
exists at a certain point in space, any point charge $q$ moving 
through that point in space will experience a magnetic force 
which is perpendicular both to the direction of the magnetic 
field and to the direction of the velocity of the moving charge.

  The direction of the magnetic field at any point in space
can be measured by placing a small compass at that point; the
$N$ pole of the compass will point in the direction of the
magnetic field.  Pictorial representations of magnetic fields
are usually produced by drawing magnetic field lines.  The 
field line passing through any point in space must be parallel 
to the magnetic field at that point.  Small arrowheads are 
usually drawn on the field lines to indicate the field 
direction.  Since the field can only point in one direction at 
one point in space, field lines can never cross.  Magnetic 
field lines always make complete loops, and field lines are 
closest together where the magnetic field strength is largest.  

  Magnetic field strength is measured in units of (N/C)/(m/s).
This combination of units is called a tesla (T) to honor
Nikola Tesla, a 20$^{th}$ century physicist famous for his
work on electromagnetic induction.  The Earth's magnetic field
at the location of Tempe points roughly towards geographic
North with a strength of about 20-50 $\mu$T.  Inside a modern
steel-frame building, the ambient field can vary significantly
from the Earth's field at that location.  The field strength
near the end of a common bar magnet is typically hundreds of
times larger than the field of the Earth.

\noindent{\bf Part One}

You will first use a small compass
to trace the magnetic field lines of a bar magnet
and of a horseshoe magnet.
\smallskip
\noindent{\bf Procedure}   

\item{1.} Tape a sheet of paper to your lab table with
the long edge of the paper parallel to the ambient field
direction at your location.  When using the compass to 
determine the ambient field direction, make sure that 
all bar magnets are far away.

\item{2.} Center a bar magnet on the paper with its 
south pole pointing in the direction of the ambient field
at your location.  Trace the bar magnet on the paper, then
remove the magnet so that you can indicate on the paper
the S and N pole locations of the magnet, and finally
replace the magnet.

\item{3.} Use a small compass to trace a magnetic
field line for the bar magnet.  The procedure for
line tracing is described in steps 4-7 and indicated
in the figure below.
\smallskip
\centerline{\psfig
{figure=/home/gbadams/born/class/101/lab/images/Bandcompass.eps,height=6.0cm}}
\smallskip
\item{4.} Place the compass close to the north pole of the
bar magnet (not directly on the centerline).  Make two dots
on the paper, one on either side of the compass and aligned
with the compass needle.

\item{5.} Move the compass so that the south-seeking pole
of the needle is directly over the second dot.  Make a new
dot exactly in front of the north-seeking pole of the 
needle.

\item{6.} Repeat step \#5, moving the compass so that the
south-seeking pole is over the most recently drawn dot, then
making a new dot just beyond the north-seeking pole.  Stop
when you get back to the bar magnet or when you hit the edge
of the paper.

\item{7.} Draw a smooth curve through the dots.  Use several
arrowheads along the curve to show the direction of the 
magnetic field.  You have now completed one magnetic field
line outside of the bar magnet; inside of the bar magnet,
the field line continues to form a complete loop.

\item{8.} Repeat steps 4-7 until you have completed enough
field lines to form a reasonable map of the magnetic field
of the bar magnet.  Four lines on each side of the magnet
is a good choice; two of the four lines should stay relatively
near to the side of the magnet and two should venture 
relatively far from the side of the magnet.

\item{9.} Repeat the above procedures to trace the field
lines of a horseshoe magnet.  Orient the magnet with the
open mouth of the horseshoe pointing in the direction of
the ambient magnetic field at your location.  Use your
compass to determine the poles and put the N pole to the
left of center.  Trace enough lines to form a reasonable
map of the magnetic field of the horseshoe magnet, both
near the mouth and near the bend (both inside the bend
and outside).

%previous sketch.

\noindent{\bf Part Two}

The magnetic field lines due to a long straight current 
make circles around the current, with the current at the
center of those circles.   The direction of the magnetic
field due to the current is given by a right-hand rule.
Grab the current with your right hand and with your 
thumb in the current direction; the curled fingers of
your hand indicate the field direction.  The magnetic
field strength $B$ due to the current $I$ is proportional to
the current, but inversely proportional to the distance $r$
from the current.  In symbols,
$$B \propto {I\over r}.$$

You will measure the current $I$ required to give a constant
value of $B$ at three different values of $r$.  You will 
determine $B$ relative to the ambient field strength.  We 
will arrange that the field due to the current is perpendicular 
to the ambient field.  In this way, if the field due to the 
current is equally as strong as the ambient field, then a 
compass needle will point at 45$^\circ$ (the direction of the
total field will be halfway between the directions of the two
component fields).  Doing so would require large currents
which would cause the wires to get dangerously hot, so instead
we will adjust the current until the compass needle points only
30$^\circ$ away from the ambient field direction.  

%Still, for 
%the largest currents in our experiment, you may smell the 
%resistor in your circuit getting warm.
\smallskip
\noindent{\bf Procedure}

\item{1.} Remove all bar magnets from your lab table.
Place a medium-sized compass on your table, far from
any power supply.  For the compasses provided, the compass
needle is then 4.80~mm above the table.  With no nearby 
currents or magnets, the compass indicates the direction 
of the ambient field.  Adjust the dial of the compass so 
that, when the compass is pointing in the ambient field 
direction, the needle is aligned with the 
30$^\circ$-210$^\circ$ direction of the dial.  In this way, 
when we use a current to deflect the needle by 30$^\circ$, 
it will point exactly in the N-S alley of the compass dial 
(making the 30$^\circ$ deflection easy to see).  THE REST 
OF THIS EXPERIMENT MUST NOW BE PERFORMED WITHOUT TOUCHING 
OR MOVING THE COMPASS IN ANY WAY.  Tape the compass to the
table to insure that it does not move.

\item{2.} Tape a wire, a part of a long circuit, to the center
of a plastic ruler.  For the provided wires, this makes the
center of the wire 6.05~mm above the bottom of the ruler.

\item{3.} You will be supplied with some one cubic centimeter
blocks, which you can use to construct stable supports of
heights 2~cm, 3~cm, and 4~cm.  Use two 2~cm supports to 
place the ruler, with the wire taped to its center, directly
over the compass; the distance between the center of the wire
and the compass needle should now be 2.125~cm.  The wire 
direction must be exactly in the ambient field direction.  
The wire connections should be made so that, when the 
current is turned on, the current will flow in the ambient 
field direction.  You should be able to clearly see the 
compass by looking down through the clear plastic ruler.  
The compass should be at the midpoint of the ruler and the 
wire should be directly over the compass needle.  See the 
left side of the figure below.
\smallskip
\centerline{\psfig
{figure=/home/gbadams/born/class/101/lab/images/BduetoI.eps,height=8.0cm}}
\smallskip
\item{4.} With the current knobs on the power supply at
their lowest settings, turn on the green power switch.
The red dot on the power supply meter should indicate
AMPS.  Slowly and gently increase the power supply current
until the needle has been deflected by 30$^\circ$ (see the
right side of the figure above); you may wish to use both
the coarse and fine current adjustments.  Record the
resulting current in Data~Table~10.1.  Decrease the power
supply current to zero.  Turn off the power switch.

\item{5.} Repeat steps \#3 and \#4 with 3-cm supports 
and with then with 4-cm supports.  In these two cases,
the distances between the needle and the wire center
should be 3.125 and 4.125~cm, respectively.

\item{6.} To test the repeatability of your measurements,
now take an additional set of readings with each set of
supports.  Record this second set of readings in 
Data~Table~10.1.  Your two sets of readings should be
reasonably similar.  Average the two readings for each
support height and record those three average values in 
Data~Table~10.1.

\noindent{\bf Results}

%\item{1.} Why is it reasonable to assume that the ambient
%field in the room does not significantly affect your
%drawings of the field lines of the bar magnet?
\item{1.} For the bar magnet, draw a compass needle\hfil\break
in each of the empty circles to represent the\hfil\break
approximate direction of the magnetic field at\hfil\break
each of those locations.  The circle at the\hfil\break
center represents INSIDE the magnet.  The\hfil\break
field at that location can only be deduced;\hfil\break
it cannot be measured.
\bigskip
\item{2.} Repeat for the horseshoe magnet.  Again,\hfil\break
the field inside the magnet can only be deduced;\hfil\break
it cannot be measured.\hfil

\item{3.} In your drawings for the field of the bar magnet, where
are the field lines closest together?  Where are they farthest
apart?  What is the significance of a concentration of field lines?
\vglue2.3in
\item{4.} Make a graph of the average $I$'s versus the
distances from Data~Table~10.1.  Draw a straight 
``line of best fit" which, as nearly as possible, passes 
through the three points on your graph; the graph location
(0,0) may be taken as a good fourth data point.  Use your
line to determine the three values of $I$ which you would
have measured at our three selected distances had the 
proportionality between distance and current been exact 
in your experiment.  Record these three values of $I$ in 
Data~Table~10.1.

\item{5.} Find the percent differences between the three
$I$ values from the line in your graph and the three
average values of $I$.  Write these three percent
differences in Data~Table~10.1 and show a sample 
calculation in the space below.
\vglue1.2in
\vfil\eject
\item{6.} Are you able to conclude, from your data and
analysis, that in order to produce a constant value of 
magnetic field strength at various distances from a 
long straight current, the required current is proportional
to the distance from the wire?  Why or why not?
